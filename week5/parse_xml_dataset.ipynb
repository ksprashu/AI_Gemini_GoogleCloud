      "[[File:Vidhana Soudha as of 8 June 2022.jpg|thumb|300px|The front façade of the Vidhana Soudha]]\n",
      "'''Bangalore''', now known officially as '''Bengaluru''' ([[Kannada]]: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ''Beṅgaḷūru''), is the capital of the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]]. It is a large, cosmopolitan city with a large working population. Bangalore is the major centre of India's information technology (IT) industry and is known worldwide as the \"Silicon Valley of India\".\n",
      "\n",
      "==Understand==\n",
      "Once called the \"Garden City of India\" and the \"Pensioner's Paradise\", these epithets don't apply to modern Bangalore.\n",
      "\n",
      "===History===\n",
      "The earliest records of a place named Bengaluru are found in a ninth-century temple in an area now known as \"Old Bangalore\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The feudal lord Kempe Gowda has been given credit for developing parts of the city. In 1537, with the assistance of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next three centuries, Bangalore existed very much in the shadow of the neighbouring city, [[Mysore]], and control of the town changed hands many times. The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city. Claiming misrule by king Krishna Raja Wodeyar III, the British took control of the Mysore Kingdom and, possibly influenced by the city's salubrious climate, moved the administrative capital to Bangalore. New telecommunication systems were laid, rail connections built, fine government buildings constructed, and the city's famous parks and gardens established. After independence, Bangalore maintained its position as the state capital of [[Karnataka]] and continues to grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, Bangalore was regarded in India as the greenest, most liberal and forward-thinking city. These attributes have propelled Bangalore to the forefront of India's high-tech industry boom, and it ranks as one of the most developed cities in India and one of the world's fastest-growing urban areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A popular myth explaining the name Bengaluru is that it originated from ''Benda Kaalu Uru'' (Town of Boiled Beans). The story is told that the name was given to the city by King Vira Ballala who, while lost in the area, was offered boiled beans by an old woman.\n",

You will also have to pay the toll charge of ₹120 when you enter the highway. It costs approximately ₹600 to get to Bangalore's central business district, and about ₹700 to [[Koramangala]]]. Journeys to anywhere in Bangalore should not cost more than ₹800–1000. More information can be found on the [http://www.bengaluruairport.com/transport/taxis.jspx airport site].\n",

Taxi drivers driving such taxis will attempt to negotiate with you a much lower fare than that charged by EasyCabs sometimes as little as ₹200–300 for a ride to the central business district. These taxis can be found just beyond the terminal plaza at the covered walkway that leads to the car park. Once you leave the walkway, some taxi drivers may become fairly aggressive and may try to take your luggage without your permission. The best thing to do is to keep track of and be in control of, your belongings. Even the most aggressive taxi driver or tout will leave you alone if you stand firm and make it clear that you do not want his help. You should only use such taxis if you have an idea of what the appropriate taxi rates are, and are willing to bargain very hard to avoid being swindled. It is recommended that you agree on a price before you enter the cab; no tip is necessary once you arrive at your destination.\n",

These operate from a pickup point a little further outside the terminal building. You can follow the signs for an app-based taxi pickup. You will need to download an app to your smartphone and have an Internet connection to be able to use these services.

      "Driving in India can be very stressful. Lane discipline is practically non-existent, excessive honking, high vehicle density, lack of regard for traffic law, combined with razor thin passing margins are common. One ride in a taxi will most likely convince you that driving yourself is not worth the risk, so if you do want to arrive by car, you will probably want to hire a car and a driver. Cost varies, but most car and driver combinations cost ₹1,400-1,700/day. The fares for hired private taxis are usually in the multiples of 4hr/{{km|40}}, fares for which start at around ₹450 for a non-air conditioned small car. Depending on where you are coming from, you may be able to negotiate a lower fare if the trip isn't far, and it may be a higher fare if you are travelling far and your driver has to travel back on his own time. Having an approximate idea of the fare or distance beforehand and persistent bargaining skills can lead to significant savings. Although it costs more, consider requesting an air conditioned car if you aren't used to the heat, especially in summer. An air conditioned car will also help filter out the air pollution, which is considerable, especially on congested roadways.

Conductors (there is one on every bus and they collect fares and issue tickets - they are always in uniform) are also helpful in telling you where/when your stop is if you ask, as are fellow passengers if they frequent the route. Posted route maps of the bus system are rare, although maps are sold at the main bus terminals (Kempegowda Bus Stand and Shivajinagar). BMTC (toll-free) {{Phone|+1-800-425-1663}}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch out: some bus drivers put their route sign on the bottom right side of the windshield instead of its place on the sign holder on the top of the windshield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buses with black display boards run within the city. Red board buses cover long-distance and go to adjoining suburbs. The ordinary city buses are white & blue or green in colour. The newer city buses tend to be blue in colour and have LED display boards. There are blue Volvo buses, called ''Vajra'', that operate mainly on IT sector routes like '''Electronic City,''' '''ITPL''' and Outer Ring Road routes, and to tourist places like [[Bannerghatta National Park]] and weekend Services to ''Wonderla''. They offer a comfortable air-conditioned ride at higher prices (1½ to 2 times the regular bus fare) than the regular buses (which are not air-conditioned). Unlike most other buses, the Vajras have illuminated LED display boards on the front and sides which display the destination and route information in English as well as Kannada.\n",
      "\n",
      "BMTC also operates ''Vayu Vajra'' services to Kempegowda International Airport from various destinations across the City. '''KIAS-9''' is the most frequent of the routes, connecting the Airport to the Majestic Bus stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "City buses are crowded during rush hours, which are at least 7-10AM and 5-9PM (M-Sa) but one can travel with little difficulty during the daytime. Bus services usually start by 5 or 6AM and are less frequent 9:30AM–10PM and rare after 10:30PM. Traffic in Bangalore is notorious: a trip across the city can take up to 4 hr, especially during rush hour times. There are no bus lanes, so buses, cabs and cars face the same traffic jams!\n",
      "\n",
      "Major buses in the city have seats reserved for ladies in the front, between the front and middle doors. The first seat near the front door is reserved for ladies' senior citizens, while the first seat behind the middle door is for the physically challenged, and the seat facing the door is for senior citizens. Generally, you can board and exit the bus from either door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is always better to buy a daily pass if you plan to travel the whole day on the bus. The daily pass costs ₹70 as of January 2018 and it comes in handy if you need to travel on several buses in a single day. Daily passes are issued by the on-duty bus conductor or at the bus stand. Using this pass you can travel in any bus (other than the Vajra) for the entire day, any number of times. Senior citizens are given a 25% concession in all buses on the production of valid ID cards (e.g. passports). Children aged 4-12 are given a 50% concession. No charge for children up to 4 years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buses are available to all major localities of the city from these three bus stands. There have been a lot of developments due to the ongoing metro project as well as efforts to decongest the city. BMTC is adding more bus stations all the time. Better to check their websites for the latest situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By train===\n",
      "There are DEMU (Diesel Electric Multiple Unit) and MEMU (Mainline Electric Multiple Unit) trains run by the South Western Railway (SWR), which connect the city centre to various suburbs, especially in the IT corridor areas of Whitefield, Outer Ring Road and Electronic City. However, speeds are low and station infrastructure can be poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By auto-rickshaw===\n",
      "{{cautionbox|Autorickshaws and taxis in Bangalore have a metered fare system. However many autorickshaw drivers will refuse to use the meter, refuse specific destinations or try to suggest a fare in advance. It is best to use Namma Yatri, Ola, Uber, or other mobile apps if you wish to avoid wrangling about the fare.}}\n",
      "[[File:BangaloreRickshaw.jpg|thumbnail|Autorickshaw in Bangalore awaiting customers. Note that black painted autos have older two-stroke engines while the green ones are newer and cleaner in terms of emissions.]]\n",
      "Auto-rickshaws (also called \"auto\") are everywhere at any time of day. They are green-and-yellow or black-and-yellow three wheeled contraptions. They are a fast (but unsafe) way to get around the city - in thick traffic, they are quicker than a taxi or bus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auto-rickshaws are supposed to charge fares as per the meter reading, which equals to ₹13 per distance kilometer, a minimum charge of ₹25 for the first {{km|1.8}} or less, and a 50% surcharge after 10PM (called \"one and a half\"). They generally tend to charge on an ad-hoc basis depending on the distance of the destination, the chances of getting another customer from the mentioned locality, and their mood. You should simply refuse to board an auto where the meter is faulty or the driver refuses to use it. Saying \"meter please\" will usually do the trick. Drivers will give you endless excuses why they cannot use the meter. Remember that they are required by law to have a working meter and use it, and this will almost always be the cheapest for you too. If they still refuse, walk away: there are plenty of other rickshaws on the roads. In fact, drivers of rickshaws that you flag down from the streets (if practical and possible) will often be more agreeable than those waiting in stands, who demand more fares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tourists should be cautious when approaching auto-rickshaws at night, or during heavy rains. Chances are they will charge exorbitant rates (some drivers may demand 100% surcharge after 10PM or 11PM), but you must refuse to board in such a case. Help could be taken from the local traffic police to avail auto-rickshaws during such circumstances. If you are a visitor and do not know the route to the destination, it is a good idea to bargain and fix the fare before boarding to avoid long, convoluted routes being used by the driver - or check the route by recording a GPS track on your mobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auto drivers commonly charge 1.5 rates for timings from 9PM to 6AM. For instance, if the meter reads ₹100, you are to pay ₹150. Catching autos on a normal fare at these times are tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to keep in mind is to be firm but not loud in an argument while travelling in the auto. Some of the less reputable drivers may team up with their friends midway to cause problems. Remember that although Bangaloreans are known for their polite and mild mannered behaviour, auto drivers are normally an exception. Some will think nothing of trying to rip you off. If in doubt, consult a local or your hotel travel desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a rickshaw driver offers to show/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse. A common tactic is to drive you to local shops where you will be pressured to buy Indian crafts that you probably don't want. Know your destination and insist upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rickshaw drivers are required by law to display their identification on the dashboard or the back of their seats. Refuse to get into a rickshaw that does not display one.\n",
      "\n",
      "If an auto driver is problematic, their identification number and report to the [http://bbmp.gov.in/ BBMP] Control room which is empowered to withdraw their auto license. This is a very effective technique to deal with them. The BBMP control room number as of December 2009 is {{Phone|+91 80 22975803}}.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you arrive in Bangalore via train, at the main train station there is an office near the taxis/auto-rickshaws which will print out a pre-paid receipt for your ride. The service costs ₹1, but will save you a potentially large amount of money by giving you an accurate value for your ride. This also allows you to avoid haggling with the driver, and acts as an official price agreement in the event that the driver wants to dispute the price of the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By car taxi or bike taxi ===\n",
      "Taxis are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Toyota Etios, Tata Indica cars or Mahindra Logan cars, which are much safer than auto-rickshaws, and the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an auto-rickshaw. Most taxi companies will charge a flat rate of ₹150 from anywhere to anywhere within city limits. Waiting or return trips will be charged extra, as will a lot of heavy luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike many other countries, taxis are '''not''' marked with 'TAXI' signs on the top. Instead, the cars are marked with the logo of the fleet operator or taxi company on the sides of the car. Only some companies like \"Meru Taxi\" are marked with the sign 'Taxi' on them. Some companies have a yellow sign with an identification number (usually a letter followed by two digits) on the top. Keep in mind that these taxis cannot be hailed from the street, but have to be called by telephone. When you call, you must give the operator your location, destination, and phone number. The operator will in turn tell you the charge (or will inform you that you must go by the meter) as well as the taxi number. The taxi will come to pick you up and call you when they are close. When you go out on the street, look at the license plate for the number they gave you—it will be the last four digits of the license plate. Alternatively, look for the yellow board atop the car with the taxi's identification number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The license plate number is usually in the format \"KA\" followed by 01 to 05, followed by two letters, followed by a four-digit number. Taxis generally have yellow license plates with black letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "On weekdays, especially during rush hours, be prepared to book a taxi a couple of hours in advance. Otherwise, the rush-hour traffic jams and high demand for taxis will make it difficult for a taxi to reach you in time. Private taxis are generally more reliable during this time – in many cases, radio cabs will be overbooked, and you might be unfortunate to be informed that your booking has been cancelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it can be hard for non-Indians to grasp at first, the system is actually very effective. If in doubt, ask a member of your hotel staff to help you\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as 2015, Rapido started operating its 2 wheeler bike taxis & autorickshaws which are a great way to get around the city and cost slightly lesser than the traditional autos, and taxis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel agents and hotels can arrange private chauffeur driven cars, and you may also hire cars to drive yourself. While expensive compared to taxis, these are the most trusted, secure, and comfortable ways to travel around the city. Driving in Bangalore can be difficult, because of poor driver discipline, but chauffeur driven services are very reasonable. These can be arranged by travel companies or online from the countries of origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By private car===\n",
      "Most taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers will be more than happy to offer you either a daily rate or an hourly rate, and take you around wherever you need to go. Alternately, your hotel or a travel company can arrange a private car.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you find a good taxi or auto driver, this can be a great way to go for a foreigner. You'll certainly pay a lot more than if you bought individual rides, but you'll always have a driver waiting for you, and he can help with recommending local tourist sites, finding a good restaurant to eat at, and otherwise coping with day-to-day life. This can take a lot of the stress out of traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rates are generally something like ₹50–100 per hour for an auto-rickshaw, and ₹150–250 per hour for a taxi. Rates for a private car booked via the hotel will probably be more. Like everything else in India, rates are very fluid.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By bicycle===\n",
      "The weather in Bangalore is extremely pleasant, but the traffic is equally hectic. So if your plan is not to go towards crowded city, you can go around [[cycling]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the sightseeing locations are within a range of {{km|15}}, so you can consider covering them on bicycle. Bicycle dealers charge ₹100-300 for entire day and you have to submit identity proof to hire bicycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "===By rental scooter===\n",
      "Travelling by rental scooter (light motorcycle) is increasingly common. Companies like [https://bounceshare.com/ Bounce], [https://vogo.in/ VOGO]{{Dead link|date=January 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} and [https://www.yulu.bike/ YULU] offer rental scooters and electric cycles (solar powered models are available), to be unlocked using an app on your smartphone. VOGO and YULU have certain hubs where the vehicle has to be parked, whereas Bounce scooters can be parked anywhere. The rates charged are comparable with those of auto rickshaws, or may be slightly higher at times. You should carry your own helmet since most of these vehicles don't come equipped. The flip side to these services is that the price charged in the end is final and cannot be bargained and sometimes these apps have poor customer services.\n",
      "\n",
      "==See==\n",
      "There are city tours that can show you the city efficiently if you are short on time. Typically, tours do ''not'' include entry fees into the attractions. Bangalore, like the rest of India, has a habit of charging foreigners a lot more than locals for attractions. For example, Tipu Sultan's Palace, which is on the half-day tour, charges ₹15 for Indians/SAARC and ₹200 for non-Indians.\n",

      "==Stay safe==\n",
      "Bangalore is a relatively safe city during day time. However, most of Bangalore practically shuts down a little before midnight, even very safe residential areas can be very desolate by 11PM. In the morning people start getting out from 5AM or 6AM, but it's usually still dark outside at that time, so exercise caution if you are in an unfamiliar area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the lower-income areas can be somewhat unsafe once it gets dark. Exercising caution and good sense will increase your chances of staying safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is not advisable to walk alone along deserted alleyways or lanes after dark. Avoid doing so in areas that you are not sure are reasonably safe\n",
      "* Avoid using an auto-rickshaw if the driver is not alone, especially at night\n",
      "* Do not flaunt jewellery, high-end mobile phones, laptops, watches etc.\n",
      "* Do not withdraw large amounts of cash from ATMs in deserted areas.\n",
      "* Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas such as exhibitions, cricket matches, train stations, etc.\n",
      "* If you are returning late from a party, it is advisable to pre-book cabs through reputed companies such as Meru, Ola, or Uber as against flagging down an auto-rickshaw on the road\n",
      "* Exercise caution in stopping to help if you see a broken down vehicle at night, especially in lonely streets and in cases where you will be outnumbered\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising incomes has brought an influx of people including white and blue collar immigrants, leading to disparities in earnings between locals, the casual labour immigrants and expatriates (people from other parts of the state and also from other countries) which arguably has resulted in a substantial increase in crime rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "==Connect==\n",
      "The area code for Bangalore is 080. When calling from overseas, dial +91 80 XXXX XXXX (if the phone is a land-line connection). If you don’t have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a color photo, and proof of local address (in Bangalore) when buying a pre-paid card. If you do not have the required paperwork, it is recommended that you ask a local friend to buy a pre-paid card on your behalf. Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public telephones are a good option and are available widely. Most shops that offer public phones sport easily visible \"STD/ISD/PCO\" signages. More often than not, public pay-phones are post-pay and there will be a person at the shop to take the payments. Check the bill generated from the machine and make the payment accordingly. Payments are always in Indian Rupees.\n",

If you are planning on travelling around outside the metropolitan area it might be a good idea to buy a mobile phone and use one of the pre-paid plans to get yourself connected whilst you are still in the city. However, there may be network congestion in certain areas and hence, slow internet connections.\n",

      "There are plenty of Internet centres which charge between ₹10-₹25 per hr. If you have a laptop with Wi-Fi connection, free internet services are available at some malls, restaurants, and hotels. However, free public Wi-Fi is not the norm. MG Road and Brigade road now has street-wide free Wi-Fi. Hop on to the '''Namma Wi-Fi''' wireless network and register using your mobile number for a one-time password for internet access.\n",

      "High speed USB data cards are very common and all telecom providers (see '''Connect''' section) offer these over-the-counter at their stores.

      "It is always a good idea to carry a minimal medicine kit with medicines for common diseases and conditions. Most of the international medicines are available in medical stores, though the name and brand may be different. So, it is advisable to do some research on the alternatives or consult a general physician, if needed.\n",

Typically, travel agencies will offer a better exchange rate than banks. Some \"extraoficial\" agencies can be found around the commercial area of M.G. Road.

       "'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Bangalore\\'\\'\\', now known officially as \\'\\'\\'Bengaluru\\'\\'\\' ([[Kannada]]: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು \\'\\'Beṅgaḷūru\\'\\'), is the capital of the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]]. It is a large, cosmopolitan city with a large working population. Bangalore is the major centre of India\\'s information technology (IT) industry and is known worldwide as the \"Silicon Valley of India\".\\n\\n==Understand==\\nOnce called the \"Garden City of India\" and the \"Pensioner\\'s Paradise\", these epithets don\\'t apply to modern Bangalore.\\n\\n===History===\\nThe earliest records of a place named Bengaluru are found in a ninth-century temple in an area now known as \"Old Bangalore\".\\n\\nThe feudal lord Kempe Gowda has been given credit for developing parts of the city. In 1537, with the assistance of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.\\n\\nDuring the next three centuries, Bangalore existed very much in the shadow of the neighbouring city, [[Mysore]], and control of the town changed hands many times. The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city. Claiming misrule by king Krishna Raja Wodeyar III, the British took control of the Mysore Kingdom and, possibly influenced by the city\\'s salubrious climate, moved the administrative capital to Bangalore. New telecommunication systems were laid, rail connections built, fine government buildings constructed, and the city\\'s famous parks and gardens established. After independence, Bangalore maintained its position as the state capital of [[Karnataka]] and continues to grow.\\n\\nFor many years, Bangalore was regarded in India as the greenest, most liberal and forward-thinking city. These attributes have propelled Bangalore to the forefront of India\\'s high-tech industry boom, and it ranks as one of the most developed cities in India and one of the world\\'s fastest-growing urban areas.\\n\\nA popular myth explaining the name Bengaluru is that it originated from \\'\\'Benda Kaalu Uru\\'\\' (Town of Boiled Beans). The story is told that the name was given to the city by King Vira Ballala who, while lost in the area, was offered boiled beans by an old woman.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh = 28.4 | febhigh = 30.9 | marhigh = 33.4 | aprhigh = 34.1\\n| mayhigh = 33.1 | junhigh = 29.7 | julhigh = 28.3 | aughigh = 28.1\\n| sephigh = 28.6 | octhigh = 28.5 | novhigh = 27.4 | dechigh = 26.9\\n\\n| janlow = 16.1 | feblow = 17.6 | marlow = 20.2 | aprlow = 22.1\\n| maylow = 21.8 | junlow = 20.6 | jullow = 20.1 | auglow = 20.0\\n| seplow = 20.0 | octlow = 19.8 | novlow = 18.3 | declow = 16.4\\n\\n| janprecip = 1.6 | febprecip = 7.1 | marprecip = 14.7 | aprprecip = 61.7\\n| mayprecip = 128.7 | junprecip = 110.3 | julprecip = 116.4 | augprecip = 162.7\\n| sepprecip = 208.3 | octprecip = 186.4 | novprecip = 64.5 | decprecip = 15.4\\n| description = \\'\\'\\'[https://cdsp.imdpune.gov.in/extremes_1991_2020/?stn=43295 IMD]\\'\\'\\'\\n}}\\nUnlike the major cities of India which are extremely hot in the summer months, Bangalore enjoys a relatively mild climate all year round.\\n\\n* Summer – February to May (peak temperature is during April and May)\\n* Monsoon – June to October (the heaviest rains are typically between June and August)\\n* Winter – November to January (with January being the coldest month)\\n\\nSummer temperatures can reach  and early morning temperatures in the winter hover around . However, Bangalore has unpredictable weather, unlike certain western cities. It is quite common to have a warm sunny day followed by evening showers ending with cool nights. So, be prepared for rain for the better part of the year, especially from May to November.\\n\\n==Talk==\\nBeing the capital of [[Karnataka]], the widely spoken and official language in Bangalore is \\'\\'\\'[[Kannada phrasebook|Kannada]]\\'\\'\\'. Most people can speak and understand English and [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]]. Other Indian languages such as [[Malayalam phrasebook|Malayalam]], [[Tamil phrasebook|Tamil]], [[Telugu phrasebook|Telugu]], [[Bengali phrasebook|Bengali]] and [[Urdu]] are spoken by the respective migrant and minority communities. As Bangalore is a commercial and cultural hub, it has a smattering of [[Konkani]], [[Marathi]] and [[Tulu]] speakers.\\n\\nMost auto rickshaw drivers, bus conductors and shop assistants can have a conversation in at least basic English. Some of them will be able to understand Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Signs are generally written in both Kannada and English. However, a basic knowledge of Kannada comes very handy when interacting with locals.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=[[Kempegowda International Airport]] | alt= | url=http://www.bengaluruairport.com/ | email=feedback@bialairport.com\\n| address=Devanahalli | lat=13.2004 | long=77.7090 | directions= from the central business district of Bangalore (Mahatma Gandhi Road) and  from Bengaluru City railway station\\n| phone=+91 80 6678-2255, +91 80 6678-2251 | tollfree=+1 800 425 4425 | fax=\\n| hours=The airport is occasionally subject to operational restrictions due to fog from 15 November to 15 February between 3AM-8:30AM (IST).

When departing from the airport, make sure to check restrictions on times for baggage check-in, and make sure to bring a printout of your boarding pass with you to the airport.

This is the cheapest and an extremely convenient way to get to the airport.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Taxis\\'\\'\\'\\n**\\'\\'\\'Airport-approved taxis\\'\\'\\' There is a dedicated taxi holding area for travellers arriving at the airport. Taxis at this holding area use meters at the rate of ₹19.5 per kilometer. You will also have to pay the toll charge of ₹120 when you enter the highway. It costs approximately ₹600 to get to Bangalore\\'s central business district, and about ₹700 to [[Koramangala]]]. Journeys to anywhere in Bangalore should not cost more than ₹800–1000. More information can be found on the [http://www.bengaluruairport.com/transport/taxis.jspx airport site].\\n** \\'\\'\\'Unofficial taxis\\'\\'\\' You may be able to find a ride into Bangalore City at a much cheaper rate by taking a \\'\\'\\'taxi not approved by the airport\\'\\'\\', but only \\'\\'if you are willing to take a risk\\'\\'. Taxi drivers driving such taxis will attempt to negotiate with you a much lower fare than that charged by EasyCabs sometimes as little as ₹200–300 for a ride to the central business district. These taxis can be found just beyond the terminal plaza at the covered walkway that leads to the car park. Once you leave the walkway, some taxi drivers may become fairly aggressive and may try to take your luggage without your permission. The best thing to do is to keep track of and be in control of, your belongings. Even the most aggressive taxi driver or tout will leave you alone if you stand firm and make it clear that you do not want his help. You should only use such taxis if you have an idea of what the appropriate taxi rates are, and are willing to bargain very hard to avoid being swindled. It is recommended that you agree on a price before you enter the cab; no tip is necessary once you arrive at your destination.\\n** \\'\\'\\'App-based taxis\\'\\'\\' Smartphone app-based taxi services such as Meru Cabs, Ola, Rapido and Uber operate in Bangalore and many provide services to the airport. These operate from a pickup point a little further outside the terminal building. You can follow the signs for an app-based taxi pickup. You will need to download an app to your smartphone and have an Internet connection to be able to use these services. If you don\\'t have an Indian SIM card or cheap roaming data, it may be better to use one of the other taxi services, as the Airport WiFi can be overloaded at peak times.\\n***\\'\\'\\'[https://www.uber.com/airports/blr/ Uber]\\'\\'\\' has a flat rate service from the airport to anywhere in the city for ₹549, including the toll charges.\\n***\\'\\'\\'[https://www.olacabs.com/ Ola]\\'\\'\\' also operates taxis via their app from the airport.\\n***[https://www.onenesstaxi.com \\'\\'\\'Oneness Taxi\\'\\'\\'] best Chandigarh to Delhi taxi and Delhi to Chandigarh Taxi Services Provider.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Limousines and self-drive cars\\'\\'\\' Hertz and Akbar Travels provide pre-paid limousine and car rental facilities through counters at the airport terminal building. These cost above ₹1,200 for travel to the central business district. A pick up and drop off facility in town and at the airport are offered.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Hotel pick-up\\'\\'\\' You can arrange with your hotel to have a driver pick you up at the airport. Some hotels, especially the higher-end ones, provide this service for free if you are staying with them, although some may charge you anything around ₹2,500 (far higher than just taking a taxi). The driver will be waiting in the arrival area of the airport with a sign bearing your name.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Helicopter\\'\\'\\' If you are in a hurry and have a lot of money, helicopter services are offered by \\'\\'\\'Birdie\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'Deccan Aviation\\'\\'\\'.

This is to cater for the large number of travellers between Bangalore and Mysore.

However, sleeper class (non air-con) train travel from Mumbai to Bangalore is economical and you can have a view of some lush evergreen forests and river valleys across Western India.

However, the newer Volvo buses are all equipped with electronic displays that show the destination in Kannada and English one after the other. Non-Volvo buses are being gradually retrofitted with these electronic displays; this should make bus travel much simpler if you are unfamiliar with the local language. However, there are still many of the older Ashok Leyland and even some very old Tata buses plying the roads, so it is best to go by timings or ask the conductor where the bus is heading (usually by asking the destination name like its a question, such as \"Mysore?\", and hearing if the conductor responds with the same name or another one).\\n\\n==== Bus companies ====\\n* [http://www.durgamba.com/ Durgamba Motors]\\n* [http://ksrtc.in/ Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation] (KSRTC)- Operated by Govt. of Karnataka. Counters are present all over the city for reservations, list on the website.\\n* [http://kpntravels.in/ KPN Travels] - From the direction of [[Tamil Nadu]]\\n* [http://www.vrlbus.in/ VRL Travels] - From most places north of Bangalore\\n* [http://citytravels.co.in City Travels]- From the direction of Tamil Nadu\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nDriving in India can be very stressful. Lane discipline is practically non-existent, excessive honking, high vehicle density, lack of regard for traffic law, combined with razor thin passing margins are common. One ride in a taxi will most likely convince you that driving yourself is not worth the risk, so if you do want to arrive by car, you will probably want to hire a car and a driver. Cost varies, but most car and driver combinations cost ₹1,400-1,700/day. The fares for hired private taxis are usually in the multiples of 4hr/, fares for which start at around ₹450 for a non-air conditioned small car. Depending on where you are coming from, you may be able to negotiate a lower fare if the trip isn\\'t far, and it may be a higher fare if you are travelling far and your driver has to travel back on his own time. Having an approximate idea of the fare or distance beforehand and persistent bargaining skills can lead to significant savings. Although it costs more, consider requesting an air conditioned car if you aren\\'t used to the heat, especially in summer. An air conditioned car will also help filter out the air pollution, which is considerable, especially on congested roadways. If you want something even more special, such as a fancy car or SUV, be prepared to pay extra.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n\\n\\n=== By metro ===\\n\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'[https://english.bmrc.co.in/#/schematic-route-map Namma Metro]\\'\\'\\' is an efficient cross-city rail service in Bangalore. As of November 2023, there are two lines (green and purple) intersecting at Kempegowda Bus Station (Majestic Terminal):\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Green Line\\'\\'\\'  (Nagasandra–Silk Institute)\\n* \\'\\'\\'Purple Line\\'\\'\\'  (Whitefield (Kadugodi)–Challaghatta)\\n\\nTickets can be bought at any station. Fares depend on the number of stations you travel. Minimum fare is ₹10 and maximum is ₹60. A card costing ₹50 will save you from the queues and can be recharged online (recommended to recharge in the counters). The cards offer a 5% discount on the ordinary fare. There is no other concession for seniors, women, etc. Tickets are to be purchased for children above 3 feet in height (independent of age).\\n\\nIf you get a smart token (the single journey ticket), remember that it has to be returned at the station you get off at, so make sure not to lose it during the ride. All trains are 6-coach trains with the front and the back part reserved to women\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nBuses are cheap and usually frequent (though expensive compared to other states). But travelling on them can be very difficult if you don\\'t know the system well. Now, most buses have digital signage alternating between the local language Kannada and English but some buses still display the old printed signs with only the route number in English, with the destination and route information written in Kannada. Of course, even with digital signage the buses can take a long time to change the displayed language, meaning that it can be easy to miss your bus. This means you will have to \\'\\'\\'know what route number you need\\'\\'\\' before you get on, which you can find from [http://bmtcroutes.in/ BMTCRoutes.in website] or [http://narasimhadatta.info Desiroutes], entering your starting point and end point on Google maps, or by asking locals.\\n\\nNot all bus stops are clearly marked, so it can be a little tricky on your first trip. Groups of people standing around can be a good indicator that the bus will stop there. Also, it\\'s a good idea to ask the driver or conductor if they stop at the stop you want to go to (a 500 and a 500Q will not go to all the same stops). Just ask the name in a questioning tone and you will get a response. Conductors (there is one on every bus and they collect fares and issue tickets - they are always in uniform) are also helpful in telling you where/when your stop is if you ask, as are fellow passengers if they frequent the route. Posted route maps of the bus system are rare, although maps are sold at the main bus terminals (Kempegowda Bus Stand and Shivajinagar). BMTC (toll-free) .\\n\\nWatch out: some bus drivers put their route sign on the bottom right side of the windshield instead of its place on the sign holder on the top of the windshield.\\n\\nBuses with black display boards run within the city. Red board buses cover long-distance and go to adjoining suburbs. The ordinary city buses are white & blue or green in colour. The newer city buses tend to be blue in colour and have LED display boards. There are blue Volvo buses, called \\'\\'Vajra\\'\\', that operate mainly on IT sector routes like \\'\\'\\'Electronic City,\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'ITPL\\'\\'\\' and Outer Ring Road routes, and to tourist places like [[Bannerghatta National Park]] and weekend Services to \\'\\'Wonderla\\'\\'. They offer a comfortable air-conditioned ride at higher prices (1½ to 2 times the regular bus fare) than the regular buses (which are not air-conditioned). Unlike most other buses, the Vajras have illuminated LED display boards on the front and sides which display the destination and route information in English as well as Kannada.\\n\\nBMTC also operates \\'\\'Vayu Vajra\\'\\' services to Kempegowda International Airport from various destinations across the City. \\'\\'\\'KIAS-9\\'\\'\\' is the most frequent of the routes, connecting the Airport to the Majestic Bus stand.\\n\\nCity buses are crowded during rush hours, which are at least 7-10AM and 5-9PM (M-Sa) but one can travel with little difficulty during the daytime. Bus services usually start by 5 or 6AM and are less frequent 9:30AM–10PM and rare after 10:30PM. Traffic in Bangalore is notorious: a trip across the city can take up to 4 hr, especially during rush hour times. There are no bus lanes, so buses, cabs and cars face the same traffic jams!\\n\\nMajor buses in the city have seats reserved for ladies in the front, between the front and middle doors. The first seat near the front door is reserved for ladies\\' senior citizens, while the first seat behind the middle door is for the physically challenged, and the seat facing the door is for senior citizens. Generally, you can board and exit the bus from either door.\\n\\nIt is always better to buy a daily pass if you plan to travel the whole day on the bus. The daily pass costs ₹70 as of January 2018 and it comes in handy if you need to travel on several buses in a single day. Daily passes are issued by the on-duty bus conductor or at the bus stand. Using this pass you can travel in any bus (other than the Vajra) for the entire day, any number of times. Senior citizens are given a 25% concession in all buses on the production of valid ID cards (e.g. passports). Children aged 4-12 are given a 50% concession. No charge for children up to 4 years of age.\\n\\nBuses are available to all major localities of the city from these three bus stands. There have been a lot of developments due to the ongoing metro project as well as efforts to decongest the city. BMTC is adding more bus stations all the time. Better to check their websites for the latest situation.\\n\\n===By train===\\nThere are DEMU (Diesel Electric Multiple Unit) and MEMU (Mainline Electric Multiple Unit) trains run by the South Western Railway (SWR), which connect the city centre to various suburbs, especially in the IT corridor areas of Whitefield, Outer Ring Road and Electronic City. However, speeds are low and station infrastructure can be poor.\\n\\n===By auto-rickshaw===\\n\\n\\nAuto-rickshaws (also called \"auto\") are everywhere at any time of day. They are green-and-yellow or black-and-yellow three wheeled contraptions. They are a fast (but unsafe) way to get around the city - in thick traffic, they are quicker than a taxi or bus.\\n\\nAuto-rickshaws are supposed to charge fares as per the meter reading, which equals to ₹13 per distance kilometer, a minimum charge of ₹25 for the first  or less, and a 50% surcharge after 10PM (called \"one and a half\"). They generally tend to charge on an ad-hoc basis depending on the distance of the destination, the chances of getting another customer from the mentioned locality, and their mood. You should simply refuse to board an auto where the meter is faulty or the driver refuses to use it. Saying \"meter please\" will usually do the trick. Drivers will give you endless excuses why they cannot use the meter. Remember that they are required by law to have a working meter and use it, and this will almost always be the cheapest for you too. If they still refuse, walk away: there are plenty of other rickshaws on the roads. In fact, drivers of rickshaws that you flag down from the streets (if practical and possible) will often be more agreeable than those waiting in stands, who demand more fares.\\n\\nTourists should be cautious when approaching auto-rickshaws at night, or during heavy rains. Chances are they will charge exorbitant rates (some drivers may demand 100% surcharge after 10PM or 11PM), but you must refuse to board in such a case. Help could be taken from the local traffic police to avail auto-rickshaws during such circumstances. If you are a visitor and do not know the route to the destination, it is a good idea to bargain and fix the fare before boarding to avoid long, convoluted routes being used by the driver - or check the route by recording a GPS track on your mobile.\\n\\nAuto drivers commonly charge 1.5 rates for timings from 9PM to 6AM. For instance, if the meter reads ₹100, you are to pay ₹150. Catching autos on a normal fare at these times are tough.\\n\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to be firm but not loud in an argument while travelling in the auto. Some of the less reputable drivers may team up with their friends midway to cause problems. Remember that although Bangaloreans are known for their polite and mild mannered behaviour, auto drivers are normally an exception. Some will think nothing of trying to rip you off. If in doubt, consult a local or your hotel travel desk.\\n\\nIf a rickshaw driver offers to show/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse. A common tactic is to drive you to local shops where you will be pressured to buy Indian crafts that you probably don\\'t want. Know your destination and insist upon it.\\n\\nRickshaw drivers are required by law to display their identification on the dashboard or the back of their seats. Refuse to get into a rickshaw that does not display one.\\n\\nIf an auto driver is problematic, their identification number and report to the [http://bbmp.gov.in/ BBMP] Control room which is empowered to withdraw their auto license. This is a very effective technique to deal with them. The BBMP control room number as of December 2009 is .\\n\\nIf you arrive in Bangalore via train, at the main train station there is an office near the taxis/auto-rickshaws which will print out a pre-paid receipt for your ride. The service costs ₹1, but will save you a potentially large amount of money by giving you an accurate value for your ride. This also allows you to avoid haggling with the driver, and acts as an official price agreement in the event that the driver wants to dispute the price of the ride.\\n\\n===By car taxi or bike taxi ===\\nTaxis are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Toyota Etios, Tata Indica cars or Mahindra Logan cars, which are much safer than auto-rickshaws, and the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an auto-rickshaw. Most taxi companies will charge a flat rate of ₹150 from anywhere to anywhere within city limits. Waiting or return trips will be charged extra, as will a lot of heavy luggage.\\n\\nUnlike many other countries, taxis are \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' marked with \\'TAXI\\' signs on the top. Instead, the cars are marked with the logo of the fleet operator or taxi company on the sides of the car. Only some companies like \"Meru Taxi\" are marked with the sign \\'Taxi\\' on them. Some companies have a yellow sign with an identification number (usually a letter followed by two digits) on the top. Keep in mind that these taxis cannot be hailed from the street, but have to be called by telephone. When you call, you must give the operator your location, destination, and phone number. The operator will in turn tell you the charge (or will inform you that you must go by the meter) as well as the taxi number. The taxi will come to pick you up and call you when they are close. When you go out on the street, look at the license plate for the number they gave you—it will be the last four digits of the license plate. Alternatively, look for the yellow board atop the car with the taxi\\'s identification number.\\n\\nThe license plate number is usually in the format \"KA\" followed by 01 to 05, followed by two letters, followed by a four-digit number. Taxis generally have yellow license plates with black letters.\\n\\nOn weekdays, especially during rush hours, be prepared to book a taxi a couple of hours in advance. Otherwise, the rush-hour traffic jams and high demand for taxis will make it difficult for a taxi to reach you in time. Private taxis are generally more reliable during this time – in many cases, radio cabs will be overbooked, and you might be unfortunate to be informed that your booking has been cancelled.\\n\\nAlthough it can be hard for non-Indians to grasp at first, the system is actually very effective. If in doubt, ask a member of your hotel staff to help you\\n\\nAs early as 2015, Rapido started operating its 2 wheeler bike taxis & autorickshaws which are a great way to get around the city and cost slightly lesser than the traditional autos, and taxis.\\n\\nTravel agents and hotels can arrange private chauffeur driven cars, and you may also hire cars to drive yourself. While expensive compared to taxis, these are the most trusted, secure, and comfortable ways to travel around the city. Driving in Bangalore can be difficult, because of poor driver discipline, but chauffeur driven services are very reasonable. These can be arranged by travel companies or online from the countries of origin.\\n\\n===By private car===\\nMost taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers will be more than happy to offer you either a daily rate or an hourly rate, and take you around wherever you need to go. Alternately, your hotel or a travel company can arrange a private car.\\n\\nIf you find a good taxi or auto driver, this can be a great way to go for a foreigner. You\\'ll certainly pay a lot more than if you bought individual rides, but you\\'ll always have a driver waiting for you, and he can help with recommending local tourist sites, finding a good restaurant to eat at, and otherwise coping with day-to-day life. This can take a lot of the stress out of traveling.\\n\\nRates are generally something like ₹50–100 per hour for an auto-rickshaw, and ₹150–250 per hour for a taxi. Rates for a private car booked via the hotel will probably be more. Like everything else in India, rates are very fluid.\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\nThe weather in Bangalore is extremely pleasant, but the traffic is equally hectic. So if your plan is not to go towards crowded city, you can go around [[cycling]].\\n\\nMost of the sightseeing locations are within a range of , so you can consider covering them on bicycle. Bicycle dealers charge ₹100-300 for entire day and you have to submit identity proof to hire bicycle.\\n\\n===By rental scooter===\\nTravelling by rental scooter (light motorcycle) is increasingly common. Companies like [https://bounceshare.com/ Bounce], [https://vogo.in/ VOGO] and [https://www.yulu.bike/ YULU] offer rental scooters and electric cycles (solar powered models are available), to be unlocked using an app on your smartphone. VOGO and YULU have certain hubs where the vehicle has to be parked, whereas Bounce scooters can be parked anywhere. The rates charged are comparable with those of auto rickshaws, or may be slightly higher at times. You should carry your own helmet since most of these vehicles don\\'t come equipped. The flip side to these services is that the price charged in the end is final and cannot be bargained and sometimes these apps have poor customer services.\\n\\n==See==\\nThere are city tours that can show you the city efficiently if you are short on time. Typically, tours do \\'\\'not\\'\\' include entry fees into the attractions. Bangalore, like the rest of India, has a habit of charging foreigners a lot more than locals for attractions. For example, Tipu Sultan\\'s Palace, which is on the half-day tour, charges ₹15 for Indians/SAARC and ₹200 for non-Indians.\\n\\n===Cubbon Park area===\\n\\n\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Attara Kacheri | alt= | url=http://hck.gov.in/ | email=\\n| address=Dr Ambedkar Rd | lat=12.978056 | long=77.5925 | directions=metro: \\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q104755615\\n| lastedit=2023-04-03\\n| content=A two-storey neoclassical red-painted stone and brick building, hosting the High Court of Karnataka.

Most of the available positions are in the IT field but not necessarily IT based. Several expats do marketing, quality assurance, accent training and translation among other things. All jobs in India require an employment visa which must be obtained abroad and sponsored by the hiring company in India. In general, the salary for expats is very high compared to the local Indian wage. The best resource for jobs is through the expat community. Ask around but a good place to meet expats is the Sunday brunches at the 5-star hotels or at the numerous coffee shops in and around the MG Road area.\\n\\n== Eat ==\\nBangalore has a wide variety of food options. Foreigners will want to look for cleanliness in choosing a place to eat. Also don\\'t expect the exterior to be too fancy, observe the cleanliness of the inside and the servers when choosing a place to eat! Eating options include high end restaurants to chains to temples to mom and pop shops and of course street vendors! Restaurants usually label if they serve only vegetarian (veg or pure veg) or both veg and non-veg cuisine. If you haven\\'t been in India long, it is safer to take bottled water. But juices and other drinks are usually OK.\\n\\nThere are numerous established south Indian joints that serve authentic dosais and idlis such as MTR, CTR, Vidyarthi Bhavan and so on! Make sure to try out the classic Benne Masala Dose and a cup of filter coffee at one of these places.\\n\\nThere are also hundreds of young coconut and sugarcane juice stands! A nice refresher as you go around town! Both are good for keeping cool and energized. A coconut goes for ₹25-30 (some stands may have smaller coconuts for ₹10-15). Sugar cane juice runs ₹10-15 per cup.\\nBangalore is far from the sea, and as such the quality of seafood can vary. Some of the higher end and popular seafood places manage this well, but foreign travellers may want to tread a bit carefully.\\n\\nForeigners might want to only drink bottled water and eat only chutneys that are made with bottled or filtered water. Also, beef is forbidden to be on the menu in Karnataka restaurants.\\n\\nThe  Road is the Eat Street of Koramangala. Pizza Hut, Domino\\'s, KFC, Taco Bell, Au Bon Pain are all found here. There are also many non-chains serving local Indian cuisine. Chandni Chowk is a great option if you want the rural Punjabi dhaba experience.\\n\\nWisdom Cafe, near the AlienWare showroom is a really cosy place to have some snacks or lunch. So is the Hole in the Wall cafe, on the back street behind Maharaja Hotel. Serves great coffee and English breakfast. So does Cafe Terra, near Wipro park crossing. Adjacent to it is a really popular food joint called Little Home. It serves nice North Indian food at a very reasonable price. It\\'s really popular with the young working populace. Naturals Ice cream parlour is a hit with the hip crowd; on weekend nights you may find queues outside.\\n\\n===Budget===\\nBangalore has hundreds of fast food joints serving South Indian vegetarian food. They usually are identified with small round steel tables and diners standing around them having food. Dosas, idlis, vadas, curd rice, vegetable pulao, rice with sambar, lemon rice are usually standard fare. Quality widely varies, since most of them cater to working people.\\n\\n* {{eat\\n| name=Kerala Restaurant | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=near Syndicate Bank, Yeshwantpur Railway Road\\n| phone=+91 9895760965 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-06-25\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{eat\\n| name=The Adiga\\'s chain | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Restaurants to the south of Bangalore.

Or, you can even trust (to some extent) a broker who voluntarily offers help, but be sure you take a good look at the rooms before you pay any money to the lodge and the broker. But there is a wrong notion in the minds of people in and around Majestic that whenever you go in pairs, they tend to look at you with a wrong and suspicious look.

However, most of Bangalore practically shuts down a little before midnight, even very safe residential areas can be very desolate by 11PM. In the morning people start getting out from 5AM or 6AM, but it\\'s usually still dark outside at that time, so exercise caution if you are in an unfamiliar area.\\n\\nSome of the lower-income areas can be somewhat unsafe once it gets dark. Exercising caution and good sense will increase your chances of staying safe.\\n\\n* It is not advisable to walk alone along deserted alleyways or lanes after dark. Avoid doing so in areas that you are not sure are reasonably safe\\n* Avoid using an auto-rickshaw if the driver is not alone, especially at night\\n* Do not flaunt jewellery, high-end mobile phones, laptops, watches etc.\\n* Do not withdraw large amounts of cash from ATMs in deserted areas.\\n* Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas such as exhibitions, cricket matches, train stations, etc.\\n* If you are returning late from a party, it is advisable to pre-book cabs through reputed companies such as Meru, Ola, or Uber as against flagging down an auto-rickshaw on the road\\n* Exercise caution in stopping to help if you see a broken down vehicle at night, especially in lonely streets and in cases where you will be outnumbered\\n\\nRising incomes has brought an influx of people including white and blue collar immigrants, leading to disparities in earnings between locals, the casual labour immigrants and expatriates (people from other parts of the state and also from other countries) which arguably has resulted in a substantial increase in crime rates.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nThe area code for Bangalore is 080. When calling from overseas, dial +91 80 XXXX XXXX (if the phone is a land-line connection). If you don’t have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a color photo, and proof of local address (in Bangalore) when buying a pre-paid card. If you do not have the required paperwork, it is recommended that you ask a local friend to buy a pre-paid card on your behalf. Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.\\n\\nPublic telephones are a good option and are available widely. Most shops that offer public phones sport easily visible \"STD/ISD/PCO\" signages. More often than not, public pay-phones are post-pay and there will be a person at the shop to take the payments. Check the bill generated from the machine and make the payment accordingly. Payments are always in Indian Rupees.\\n\\n===Cellular===\\nMobile phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers ([http://www.airtel.in/  Airtel], [http://karnataka.bsnl.co.in/ BSNL], [http://www.jio.com/ Reliance Jio], Idea-[http://www.vodafone.in/ Vodafone]) offering a wide variety of plans. If you are planning on travelling around outside the metropolitan area it might be a good idea to buy a mobile phone and use one of the pre-paid plans to get yourself connected whilst you are still in the city. However, there may be network congestion in certain areas and hence, slow internet connections.\\n\\n===Internet===\\nThere are plenty of Internet centres which charge between ₹10-₹25 per hr. If you have a laptop with Wi-Fi connection, free internet services are available at some malls, restaurants, and hotels. However, free public Wi-Fi is not the norm. MG Road and Brigade road now has street-wide free Wi-Fi. Hop on to the \\'\\'\\'Namma Wi-Fi\\'\\'\\' wireless network and register using your mobile number for a one-time password for internet access.\\n\\nHigh speed USB data cards are very common and all telecom providers (see \\'\\'\\'Connect\\'\\'\\' section) offer these over-the-counter at their stores. Typically need some proof of identity and address to activate these. Nowadays, it is easier to just buy a sim card with 4G data and host a WiFi hotspot.\\n\\n==Cope==\\nBangalore is a clean city (compared to other major Indian cities such as [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolkata]]) and epidemics are rare. However, foreign tourists should be cautious about consuming water and eating at roadside stalls. It is recommended to use bottled water if the source of drinking water is unknown.\\n\\nIt is recommended to use mosquito repellents, either as a cream applied on the skin (ask for Odomos at local medical stores) or in the electronic form, during the evenings.\\n\\nIt is always a good idea to carry a minimal medicine kit with medicines for common diseases and conditions. Most of the international medicines are available in medical stores, though the name and brand may be different. So, it is advisable to do some research on the alternatives or consult a general physician, if needed.\\n\\nAmbulances can be requested by calling 108.\\n\\n===Pharmacies===\\nPharmacies are dime a dozen and you should not have any problem locating one. You do not need any prescription for Modern Medicine \\'\\'Over the Counter\\'\\' drugs, or for ayurvedic medicine (proprietary and traditional), which are available for most common ailments like fever, headache, etc., But you will need prescription for other medicines, which are categorized as \\'\\'Schedule H\\'\\' drugs.\\n\\n=== Hospitals ===\\n\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Aster CMI Hospital | alt= | url=http://asterbangalore.com/ | email=customercare.aster@asterhospital.com\\n| address= | lat=13.0546 | long=77.5919 | directions=after Bellary Rd/Hebbal Flyover continue straight onto NH44 then take slight left and then turn left\\n| phone=+91 80-43420100 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=24 hours | price=\\n| lastedit=2017-05-23\\n| content=A super-speciality hospital, part of Aster DM Healthcare group.

However, most banks offer currency exchange in all their branch offices, as do some travel agencies. Exchange rates can vary somewhat, so it is advisable to shop around. Typically, travel agencies will offer a better exchange rate than banks. Some \"extraoficial\" agencies can be found around the commercial area of M.G. Road. Those will offer a good rate, without asking to take a copy of your passport. Price could be bargained. Always double check the bank notes once the exchange is made.\\n\\n==Nearby==\\n* {{listing | type=around\\n| name=Chandra Choodeswarar Temple | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Hosur, Tamil Nadu | lat= | long= | directions= from Bangalore\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q28402744\\n| lastedit=2023-06-05\\n| content=An ancient Shiva temple.
