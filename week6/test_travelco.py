            For family-friendly beach fun, consider these options:
            Ala Moana Park in Honolulu: A local favorite with calm waters, perfect for families and a relaxing swim. It's a great alternative to the more crowded Waikiki Beach.
            Repulse Bay in Hong Kong: This large urban beach has amenities that are particularly appealing to families with young children.
            Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach in Los Angeles: These beaches in the South Bay are popular with families and offer piers and expansive sandy areas.
            In Toronto, many beaches along the Great Lakes are within a short driving distance and ideal for summer days. The guide mentions Wasaga, Sauble Beach, Sandbanks, Grand Bend, Long Point, and Turkey Point.
            Remember to always check safety guidelines and lifeguard presence at any beach you choose.
